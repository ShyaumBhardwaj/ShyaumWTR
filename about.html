            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
              Hello! My name is Shyaum Bhardwaj, and I’m currently pursuing a major in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics at the University of Guelph. My journey in the world of technology has been driven by an insatiable curiosity and a passion for problem-solving, which I apply in both my academic and personal projects.
            </p>

            <h4>Academic Background</h4>
            <p>
              At the University of Guelph, I’m working towards a strong foundation in computer science, focusing on web development, software design, and data structures. I’m equally fascinated by mathematics, which helps me approach complex problems with analytical precision. This blend of disciplines enables me to explore creative solutions in a logical, methodical way.
            </p>

            <h4>Professional Experience</h4>
            <p>
              I recently completed a co-op term as a Webmaster for the University of Guelph's History Department. In this role, I was responsible for maintaining and enhancing the department's website, ensuring that it was both functional and user-friendly. I also collaborated on digital projects that aimed to showcase the department’s historical research through interactive timelines and dynamic content updates.
            </p>
            <p>
              My time as a Webmaster taught me the importance of clear communication, especially when working with faculty members from diverse academic backgrounds. It was an exciting challenge to combine my technical skills with the needs of historians, ensuring that their research could be presented to the world in a compelling and accessible way.
            </p>

            <h4>Technical Skills & Interests</h4>
            <p>
              I have a deep love for web development and enjoy working with languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also have experience with frameworks like Bootstrap, which helps me create responsive, visually appealing designs. Beyond development, I am passionate about optimizing websites for performance and accessibility, making sure that they can be used by people of all abilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I’m not coding or studying, I enjoy exploring new technologies and staying updated on the latest trends in the tech world. Whether it's experimenting with new JavaScript libraries or learning about cutting-edge web frameworks, I’m always looking for ways to improve and expand my skill set.
            </p>

            <h4>Personal Interests</h4>
            <p>
              Outside of the tech world, I love learning about history, which is why my recent work with the History Department was such a great fit. I believe that technology has the power to bring stories from the past to life, connecting us with the rich heritage that shapes our present. In addition to my academic and technical pursuits, I also enjoy traveling, discovering different cultures, and exploring the ways technology impacts societies globally.
            </p>

            <h4>Looking Ahead</h4>
            <p>
              As I look towards the future, my goal is to continue merging my technical expertise with creative problem-solving to make an impact in the world of technology. I aspire to work in a field where I can use my web development skills to create meaningful user experiences, possibly in areas like education, history, or social impact. I'm always open to new challenges and learning opportunities, and I’m excited to see where my journey in tech will take me next.
